Greetings! And welcome to the <del>blue-plate special</del> nantaimori-style computer and security blog.  

 ## Motivations for this blog

 I've been feeling guilty for a while. I couldn't tell you how many times I've been working on an issue only to find the answer in a random blog post, saving me lots of time and headache. Or those times where blog posts helped me brush up on forgotten topics for a job interview. What have I done to pay it forward? <del>Answer some questions here and there on Reddit.</del> Nothing. Do I have answers or information that will even help people? I don’t know, but we'll figure that out together.

- I've had a lot of people help me tremendously over the years. I want to do more than this blog to give back, but hopefully this it can be a small piece of that. 
- Explaining a topic is a good way to test knowledge and reinforce. I hope writing in a blog will help me find knowledge gaps on topics I'm writing about, gain a deeper understanding, and solidify learning.
- This will serve as a catalogue of subjects I have learned about, so I can revisit them and at the same time be a place to point to as a reference for others. 

## What can you expect?
    
- Bad puns about food. 
- Topics related to Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and how they work. 
- Easy to digest (get it? Digest...) posts about hacking and security. 
- Other computer science or cyber related ideas worth sharing. 

## What's with the name? 

- Baba ganoush is of course, the best food- that delicious, creamy smokeyness. 
- GNU (GNU is Not Unix) is the Unix-like operating system that was combined with the Linux kernel to form GNU/Linux - the core of the operating systems of which I am particularly fond. 
- And .sh is for Unix shell scripts. Historically, starting with the Bourne shell (successor to the original Unix Thompson shell - 'sh', and succeeded mainly by the Bourne Again shell – bash), Unix, Linux, and some of the BSD operating systems today still make use of the .sh extension (due to the POSIX implementation of sh, ash, dash, ksh, bash, and probably some others).

Thanks for reading and hopefully see you back here for the next post!
